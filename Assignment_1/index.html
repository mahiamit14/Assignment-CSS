    <h2 class="h2">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed om screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span id="span-1">CSS is not neccessary </span> <span id="span-2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li id="li-4">External stylsheet are stored in Css files</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="h2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul id="ul">
        <li>Inline => by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal => by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External => by using a link element in to link to an external CSS File.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. how ever, <span id="span-3"> in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
